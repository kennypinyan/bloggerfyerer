# Bloggerfyerer

A super simple static blog generator. Powered by an HTML page, one script (kind of), and a markdown file.

## Installation

Clone it, run it on a server

``` python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer myFavouritePort
```

## Usage (don't use it)

1. Type words in that there .md file.
2. Save that there file.

## Optional

You'll probably want to add some styles and have it append to a specific div instead of just writing to the document.
